# Basic Computer Simulation in VHDL  
A VHDL simulation model of a **common bus system** based on the architecture described in Morris Mano's "Computer System Architecture." This project simulates the functionality of a basic hard-wired computer, including components such as the ALU, RAM, AR, DR, and more.  

---

## ðŸ“– Overview  
This project demonstrates the simulation of a basic computer architecture that utilizes a common bus system. The design is inspired by the structure outlined in Morris Mano's textbook and is implemented in VHDL for educational and demonstration purposes.  

Key components of the project:  
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs arithmetic and logical operations.  
- **Registers (AR, DR, etc.):** Used for intermediate storage and operations.  
- **RAM:** Stores instructions and data.  
- **Control Logic:** Implements hard-wired control for instruction execution.  
- **Common Bus:** Facilitates data transfer between components.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Simulated common bus architecture** to connect all components.  
- Hard-wired control logic for instruction execution.  
- Modular design for components like ALU, RAM, and registers.  
- Fully implemented in VHDL for simulation in ModelSim or similar tools.  
- Customizable and extendable for additional functionality.
